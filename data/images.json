Similarly, Nand Bhavan was the residence of Shri Krishna’s foster father Nand Maharaj in Nandgaon.\nThe 10 day long festival Known as Faag Mahotsav is held in Barsana, Nandgaon, Mathura and Varindawan and is marked by a special event every day, hosted in one of these towns like Lathmar Holi, Flower Holi, and Widow Holi etc. During Lathmar Holi, females of Barsana and Nandgaon beat mens holding a shelter over their head with wooden sticks. On the first day of Lathmar Holi, Males of Nandgaon visit Shri Radha Rani Temple to play Lathmar Holi. And on the second day, Males from Shri Radha Rani Temple visit Nand Baba Temple in Nandgaon to play Lathmar Holi. The Samaj (a large group of male members) firstly sits in the Temple of Barsana and Nandgaon before the Lathmaar Holi and enchants Krishna Prayers. This image was clicked at Nandgaon while the Krishna Enchanting was done by the Samaj.",

    "description": "NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has revisited the famous Pillars of Creation, originally photographed in 1995, revealing a sharper and wider view of the structures in this visible-light image. Astronomers combined several Hubble exposures to assemble the wider view. The towering pillars are about 5 light-years tall. The dark, finger-like feature at bottom right may be a smaller version of the giant pillars. The new image was taken with Hubble's versatile and sharp-eyed Wide Field Camera 3. The pillars are bathed in the blistering ultraviolet light from a grouping of young, massive stars located off the top of the image. Streamers of gas can be seen bleeding off the pillars as the intense radiation heats and evaporates it into space. Denser regions of the pillars are shadowing material beneath them from the powerful radiation. Stars are being born deep inside the pillars, which are made of cold hydrogen gas laced with dust. The pillars are part of a small region of the Eagle Nebula, a vast star-forming region 6,500 light-years from Earth. The colors in the image highlight emission from several chemical elements. Oxygen emission is blue, sulfur is orange, and hydrogen and nitrogen are green. A number of Herbig-Haro jets lengthened noticeably (see lower panel of linked page) in the nearly 20-year interval between the two Hubble images. Object Names: M16, Eagle Nebula, NGC 6611. A longer news release is linked here. The original image was edited to reduce noise.",

Its two-level church is partially carved in the stone of the great cliff that overhangs the foundation. San Juan de la Peña means \"Saint John of the Cliff\". The lower church includes some mozarabic architectural surviving elements, although most of the parts of the monastery (including the impressive cloister, under the great rock) are Romanesque. After the fire of 1675, a new monastery was built. The old monastery (built in 920) was declared a National Monument on 13 July 1889, and the new monastery in 1923.",

    "description": "Vertical panorama of the Milky Way during Perseids photographed from Oeschinensee with water reflections.\nHere is a step by step guide to do astrophotography. \nEquipment needed:\n1) a tripod (mandatory to avoid camera shake); \n2) a good camera; \n3) a lense with a low f number such as f/1.4 in order to have as much light as possible reaching the camera sensor. \nWeather and environment requirements: \n1) new moon phase or moon not up at all because if the moon is illuminated it creates so much light pollution that almost no stars will be visible ;\n2) a place with no light pollution (be far away from cities) ;\n3) no clouds;\n4) be late enough. In the summer in Europe it is preferable to wait after midnight because earlier the sky will still not be dark enough.\nPhoto execution:\n1) place camera on tripod;\n2) use manual focus because auto focus will not work. Do a few test shots and then zoom on the picture to verify that the stars are in good focus;\n3) use the lowest f number available, like f/1.4;\n4) find a good shutter speed of multiple seconds. For this picture a shutter speed of 8 seconds was used. A longer shutter speed would not have been possible for this 24 mm lense on a 50mp sensor or it would have resulted in star trails;\n5) use high enough ISO but usually try to avoid going above ISO 6400. For this picture ISO 6400 was used;\n6) use a 5 seconds delay for picture to be taken after clicking on the button to avoid  having the hand shaking the camera.\nDoing a panorama (optional):\n1) do multiple pictures which each new picture having the camera pointing a bit more to the top than the previous one;\n\n2) use the same manual settings for all pictures (mandatory). This includes same f number, same shutter speed, same ISO, same manual focus and especially same manual white balance;3) use a software (such as Lightroom) to merge them automatically and create a panorama.",

Of eclectic style, the interior has a unique neogothic nave built with grey stone and white marble. The stained glass is a work of painter Marcelino Santamaría from Burgos. The main altar is an artistic decorative work, carved in stone inlaid with mosaics, bronzes and enamels by the Biais house in Paris. The tabernacle is located on a high relief that represents San Francisco baptizing and preaching.",

Founded during the Gallo-Roman period, the citadel derives its reputation from its 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) long double surrounding walls interspersed by 52 towers. The medieval citadel, situated on a hill on the right bank of the river Aude, was restored at the end of the 19th century by the theorist and architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In 1997, it was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites because of its exceptional testimony to the architecture and planning of a medieval fortress town.",

It occurs in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Adults feed mainly on gelatinous zooplankton, while juveniles mainly feed on benthic algae. The switch from grazing to preying on gelatinous zooplankton coincides with the development of the bony protuberance.",
