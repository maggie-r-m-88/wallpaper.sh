Similarly, Nand Bhavan was the residence of Shri Krishna’s foster father Nand Maharaj in Nandgaon.\nThe 10 day long festival Known as Faag Mahotsav is held in Barsana, Nandgaon, Mathura and Varindawan and is marked by a special event every day, hosted in one of these towns like Lathmar Holi, Flower Holi, and Widow Holi etc. During Lathmar Holi, females of Barsana and Nandgaon beat mens holding a shelter over their head with wooden sticks. On the first day of Lathmar Holi, Males of Nandgaon visit Shri Radha Rani Temple to play Lathmar Holi. And on the second day, Males from Shri Radha Rani Temple visit Nand Baba Temple in Nandgaon to play Lathmar Holi. The Samaj (a large group of male members) firstly sits in the Temple of Barsana and Nandgaon before the Lathmaar Holi and enchants Krishna Prayers. This image was clicked at Nandgaon while the Krishna Enchanting was done by the Samaj.",

    "description": "NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has revisited the famous Pillars of Creation, originally photographed in 1995, revealing a sharper and wider view of the structures in this visible-light image. Astronomers combined several Hubble exposures to assemble the wider view. The towering pillars are about 5 light-years tall. The dark, finger-like feature at bottom right may be a smaller version of the giant pillars. The new image was taken with Hubble's versatile and sharp-eyed Wide Field Camera 3. The pillars are bathed in the blistering ultraviolet light from a grouping of young, massive stars located off the top of the image. Streamers of gas can be seen bleeding off the pillars as the intense radiation heats and evaporates it into space. Denser regions of the pillars are shadowing material beneath them from the powerful radiation. Stars are being born deep inside the pillars, which are made of cold hydrogen gas laced with dust. The pillars are part of a small region of the Eagle Nebula, a vast star-forming region 6,500 light-years from Earth. The colors in the image highlight emission from several chemical elements. Oxygen emission is blue, sulfur is orange, and hydrogen and nitrogen are green. A number of Herbig-Haro jets lengthened noticeably (see lower panel of linked page) in the nearly 20-year interval between the two Hubble images. Object Names: M16, Eagle Nebula, NGC 6611. A longer news release is linked here. The original image was edited to reduce noise.",
